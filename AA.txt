Planets outside of the Solar System have appeared in fiction since at least the 1850s, long before the first real ones were discovered in the 1990s.
Most of these fictional planets do not differ significantly from the Earth and serve only as settings for the narrative.
The majority host native lifeforms, sometimes with humans integrated into the ecosystems. Fictional planets that are not Earth-like vary in many different ways.
They may have significantly stronger or weaker gravity on their surfaces, or have a particularly hot or cold climate. Both desert planets and ocean planets appear, as do planets with unusual chemical conditions.
Various peculiar planetary shapes have been depicted, including flattened, cubic, and toroidal.
Some fictional planets exist in multiple-star systems where the orbital mechanics can lead to exotic day night or seasonal cycles, while others do not orbit any star at all.
More fancifully, planets are occasionally portrayed as having sentience, though this is less common than stars receiving the same treatment or a planet's lifeforms having a collective consciousness.
