Here’s a structured Python test that progresses from basics to advanced topics, covering a wide range of programming concepts:

Section 1: Basics (5 Questions)

	1.	Find the Average
Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average. Handle empty lists by returning None.

	2.	Even or Odd Checker
Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and prints “Even” if the number is even and “Odd” if it is odd.

	3.	Factorial Calculation
Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion.

	4.	String Reversal
Write a Python program that takes a string as input and prints the reversed string.

	5.	Count Vowels
Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string (case-insensitive).

Section 2: Intermediate (5 Questions)

	1.	Find Unique Elements
Write a Python function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements of the original list, preserving the order.

	2.	Check Palindrome
Write a Python function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Ignore case and spaces.

	3.	File Word Counter
Write a Python program that reads a text file and prints the total number of words in the file.

	4.	Matrix Transpose
Write a Python function that takes a 2D matrix (list of lists) and returns its transpose.

	5.	Find Common Elements
Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns a list of their common elements, sorted in ascending order.

Section 3: Advanced (5 Questions)

	1.	Merge Intervals
Write a Python function that takes a list of intervals (e.g., [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7]]) and merges overlapping intervals.
Example: Input: [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7]] → Output: [[1, 4], [5, 7]].

	2.	Custom Sorting
Write a Python function that sorts a list of strings based on their lengths. If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically.

	3.	LRU Cache Implementation
Write a Python class to implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache. The class should support two operations: get(key) and put(key, value). The cache should have a fixed capacity.

	4.	JSON to CSV Converter
Write a Python program that takes a JSON file as input and converts it to a CSV file.

	5.	Sudoku Validator
Write a Python function that takes a 9x9 Sudoku grid (list of lists) and checks if it is valid. A valid Sudoku grid has:

	•	Each row containing unique digits 1-9.
	•	Each column containing unique digits 1-9.
	•	Each 3x3 sub-grid containing unique digits 1-9.

Bonus Challenge Question

Shortest Path in a Maze
Write a Python function to find the shortest path in a maze represented by a 2D grid. The maze contains 0 (open path) and 1 (walls). The function should take the starting and ending coordinates and return the length of the shortest path, or -1 if no path exists. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for the solution.

This test ensures comprehensive evaluation, starting with Python basics, covering intermediate concepts, and concluding with advanced problem-solving.
